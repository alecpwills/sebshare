Directory descriptions:

- `xcd` contains the output of evaluating the published xcdiff network on the validation set
    - the `nan` values for the atomization energies can be ignored for now -- there is a conflict with how I store the barrier height data that yields nans for the final evaluation, but the scripts within the `notebooks` directory generate the MAE for the AE correctly.
- `01` contains the training output and outputs of check points from training the pre-trained SCAN model on a subset of XCDiff training molecules evaluated on the validation set. These models were generated with the default network parameters/weights.
    - `01` contains README further clarifying the test training subset and the validation set.
    - `train` subdirectory contains the `.config` file output by `train.py` capturing the arguments passed to the program
- Directories `02-14` contain training runs with progressively larger subsets of training data

        - The training data for this directory was generated by specifying `--dfit` to `prep_data.py`. The basis used was `631g`.
    - `11` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, CO2, Cl2, C, Cl, F, H, Li, N, O

    - `20` (currently working) will contain: the entire published training trajectory
        - This directory starts with the published XCDiff and trains further on the published training set
- `data` contains subdirectories containing the CCSD(T) calculations of the training subset (`test_subset_ps`, file called `subat_refres.traj`) and the validation set (`validation`, file called `val_c.traj`)
