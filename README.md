Directory descriptions:

- `xcd` contains the output of evaluating the published xcdiff network on the validation set
    - the `nan` values for the atomization energies can be ignored for now -- there is a conflict with how I store the barrier height data that yields nans for the final evaluation, but the scripts within the `notebooks` directory generate the MAE for the AE correctly.
- `01` contains the training output and outputs of check points from training the pre-trained SCAN model on a subset of XCDiff training molecules evaluated on the validation set. These models were generated with the default network parameters/weights.
    - `01` contains README further clarifying the test training subset and the validation set.
    - `train` subdirectory contains the `.config` file output by `train.py` capturing the arguments passed to the program
- Directories `02-14` contain training runs with progressively larger subsets of training data

        - The training data for this directory was generated by specifying `--dfit` to `prep_data.py`. The basis used was `631g`.
    - `11` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, CO2, Cl2, C, Cl, F, H, Li, N, O
        - The training was done with flag `hnorm` to force the H-atom and Li-atom density losses
    - `12` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, CO2, Cl2, C, Cl, F, H, Li, N, O
        - The training was done with flag `hnorm` to force the H-atom and Li-atom density losses, and had no maximum checkpoint specified.
    - `13` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, CO2, Cl2, F2, C2H2, OC, ClH, LiH, Na2, C, Cl, F, H, Li, N, Na, O
    - `14` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, CO2, Cl2, F2, C2H2, OC, ClH, LiH, Na2, C, Cl, F, H, Li, N, Na, O, NO, NO2, NH, O3, N2O, CH3, CH2, OH2, NH3, OH
    - `15` contains: the entire published training trajectory
    - `16` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, C, F, H, Li, N (same atomization/atomic energy set as `05`), and the ionization potentials C+ -> C, Li+ -> Li
    - `17` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, C, F, H, Li, N (same atomization/atomic energy set as `05`), and the barrier heights OH+N2 -> HON2, OH+CH3 -> CH4O, F+HF -> HF2
    - `18` contains: H2, N2, LiF, CNH, C, F, H, Li, N (same atomization/atomic energy set as `05`), the ionization potentials C+ -> C and Li+ -> Li, and the barrier heights OH+N2 -> HON2, OH+CH3 -> CH4O, F+HF -> HF2 
- Directories in `avs` contain training based on different setups:
    - `a` contains training based on running `prep_data.py` on the density matrices generated by my `run_pyscf.py` scripts
        - `ax` contains the same, but instead of starting the training with the pre-trained SCAN model, training starts with xcdiff itself
    - `s` contains training based purely on running `prep_data.py` using the data from `/home/awills/Documents/Research/xcdiff/data/ref/6-311`, which is a directory containing the `energies` file for target reference energies and a number of `*.dm.npy` files containing two-dimensional density matrices
        - ALL of these files are 2D, i.e. spin-polarized, hence why I have been generating the data by forcing spin polarization.
        - `sx` contains the same, but instead of starting the training with the pre-trained SCAN model, training starts with xcdiff itself
    - `s2` contains training based on copying the density matrices from my `run_pyscf.py`, THEN copying the above mentioned reference density matrices from Sebastian's data folder over the ones I generate -- so the training uses Sebastian's files for the ones that are present, and mine for the rest
        - `s2x` contains the same, but instead of starting the training with the pre-trained SCAN model, training starts with xcdiff itself
- `data` contains subdirectories containing the CCSD(T) calculations of the training subset (`test_subset_ps`, file called `subat_refres.traj`) and the validation set (`validation`, file called `val_c.traj`)
- `scripts` contains the relevant dpyscf-lite scripts (`prep_data.py`, `train.py`, `eval.py`) and the script used to generate the CCSD(T) reference data (`run_pyscf.py`)
- `notebooks` contains the scripts to generate the current figures
