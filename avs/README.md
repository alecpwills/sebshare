- Directories in `avs` contain training based on different setups:
    - `a` contains training based on running `prep_data.py` on the density matrices generated by my `run_pyscf.py` scripts
        - `ax` contains the same, but instead of starting the training with the pre-trained SCAN model, training starts with xcdiff itself
    - `s` contains training based purely on running `prep_data.py` using the data from `/home/awills/Documents/Research/xcdiff/data/ref/6-311`, which is a directory containing the `energies` file for target reference energies and a number of `*.dm.npy` files containing two-dimensional density matrices
        - ALL of these files are 2D, i.e. spin-polarized, hence why I have been generating the data by forcing spin polarization.
        - `sx` contains the same, but instead of starting the training with the pre-trained SCAN model, training starts with xcdiff itself
    - `s2` contains training based on copying the density matrices from my `run_pyscf.py`, THEN copying the above mentioned reference density matrices from Sebastian's data folder over the ones I generate -- so the training uses Sebastian's files for the ones that are present, and mine for the rest
        - `s2x` contains the same, but instead of starting the training with the pre-trained SCAN model, training starts with xcdiff itself
